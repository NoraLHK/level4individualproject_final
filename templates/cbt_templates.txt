STEP 1: Understand Your Stress Using the CBT 5-Part Model
We’ll start by exploring your recent stress using the CBT Five-Part Model, which looks at the interaction between thoughts, emotions, behaviors, body reactions, and life events.


A. Situation / Trigger
1.  What happened recently that triggered your stress?
2.  Was there a specific event, deadline, interaction, or change?
3.   What made this situation feel stressful to you personally?
4.   Have you faced a similar situation before? What happened then?

B. Thoughts
5.  What went through your mind at the moment you started feeling stressed?
6.  What was the most distressing or believable thought? (Your “hot thought”)

C. Mood
7.  What emotions did you feel? (e.g., anxious, overwhelmed, frustrated, helpless)
8.   Rate each mood from 0–100%.

D. Behaviors
9.  What did you do (or avoid doing) as a result of feeling stressed?
10. Did you procrastinate, shut down, lash out, overwork, or escape?

E. Physical Reactions

11. What physical symptoms did you notice? (e.g., muscle tension, headache, fatigue, nausea, racing heart)


STEP 2: Identify Automatic Thoughts
Let’s explore your automatic thoughts—those quick, often unspoken thoughts that show up when you’re stressed.

Assumptions & Interpretations
12. What assumptions were you making about yourself, others, or the situation? (Select all that apply)
●   “ I can’t cope with this.”
●   “ I’m going to mess this up.”
●   “They’ll be disappointed in me.”

Cognitive Distortions
13. Are you using any of these common thinking traps? (Select all that apply)
●    □ Catastrophizing – “This will be a disaster”
●    □ All-or-Nothing Thinking – “ If I don’t do this perfectly, I’ve failed”
●    □ Mind Reading – “They think I’m incompetent”
●    □ Overgeneralization – “This always happens to me”
●    □ Shoulds / Musts – “ I have to be in control”

STEP 3: Examine the Evidence
Let’s evaluate your hot thought to reduce its emotional intensity.
14. What is the factual evidence that supports this thought?
15. What is the evidence that challenges or contradicts this thought?
16. What would you say to a friend if they were thinking the same thing in this situation?

STEP 4: Create a Balanced or Alternative Thought

17. Based on the evidence, what’s a more realistic or helpful way of viewing this situation? (Tip: Acknowledge the challenge, but focus on coping—not catastrophe.)
18. How believable is this new thought to you right now? (0–100%)
19. What would change for you emotionally or behaviorally if you believed this new thought more often?
20. What is one small action you could take that reflects this new thought?


STEP 5 (Optional): Explore Deeper Beliefs
For chronic stress, it helps to look at the deeper beliefs driving your reactions.
21. Is there a deeper belief making this harder to cope with? (e.g., “ If I don’t achieve, I’m worthless”)
22. Where do you think this belief came from—family, school, culture, or past experiences?
23. How has this belief influenced your life over time?
24. If this belief were true, what would it mean about you?
25. What would it mean about others?
26. What would it mean about the world or your future?

28. List a few manageable steps to help you follow through.
29. What parts of this situation are within your control, and what parts are outside of your  control?
30. What strengths or past strategies have helped you manage similar stress before?
31. Is your stress telling you something meaningful—like a personal value or unmet need?

STEP 7: Strengthen Healthier Core Beliefs
Let’s shift from limiting beliefs to empowering ones.
32. Review the negative belief you uncovered. Is this a belief you’ve noticed coming up often in your life?

34. What new belief would you like to adopt about yourself, others, or life?
35. Write down 10 small pieces of evidence that support this new belief. Tip: These could be subtle experiences:
●   Someone thanked you
●   You helped someone
●   You followed through on something difficult
●   Someone smiled or supported you
